# Dependencies
The code generated by Cornucopia has a few dependencies that you need to import into your project's `Cargo.toml`.

## Required
* Client code: `cornucopia_client`.
* Postgres type utils: `postgres_types`.

```admonish note
By default, `cornucopia_client` has the `async` and `deadpool` features enabled. If you want to generate sync instead code, you should declare it using `default-features = false`.
```

## (Optional) Sync
* Driver: `postgres`

```admonish info
Sync connection pooling with `r2d2-postgres` works without requiring any special integration.
```

## (Optional) Async
*Requires `cornucopia_client`'s `async` feature (enabled by default)*
* Runtime: `tokio`.
* Driver: `tokio_postgres`.
* Async tools: `futures`.

## (Optional) Connection pooling
*Requires `cornucopia_client`'s `deadpool` feature (enabled by default)*
* Pooled connections: `deadpool-postgres`. 

## (Optional) Extra types
You can enable additional support for additional PostgreSQL types by adding the corresponding crates and driver features. 

| Crate        | PostgreSQL                              | Rust                                               | driver feature      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `serde_json` | `Json` `JsonB`                          | `Value`                                            | `with-serde_json-1` |
| `time`       | `Time` `Date` `Timestamp` `TimestampTZ` | `Date` `Time` `PrimitiveDateTime` `OffsetDateTime` | `with-time-0_3`     |
| `uuid`       | `Uuid`                                  | `Uuid`                                             | `with-uuid-1`       |
| `eui48`      | `MacAddr`                               | `MacAddress`                                       | `with-eui48-1`      |

## (Optional) Row serialization
*Requires the extra types from `serde_json`*
* `serde` with the `derive` feature.

## Full dependencies
The code block below shows what your dependencies might look like with every feature that async `cornucopia` supports enabled:
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "*", features = ["full"] }
deadpool-postgres = { version = "*" }
cornucopia_client = "*"
futures = "*"
tokio-postgres = { version = "*", features = [
    "with-serde_json-1",
    "with-time-0_3",
    "with-uuid-1",
    "with-eui48-1",
] }
serde = { version = "*", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "*"
time = "*"
uuid = "*"
eui48 = "*"
```
If you're generating sync code, your dependencies will look a bit different but this should give you a rough idea.

```admonish note
You should use numbered instead of wildcard `*` dependency versions, this is only for demonstration purposes. You can refer to the crate's [examples](/introduction/examples) if you're not sure which versions to use.
