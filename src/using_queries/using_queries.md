# Using your generated queries
Once you have written your queries and generated your Rust code with Cornucopia, it's time to use them. Hurray ðŸŽ‰!

Let's say you have generated your Rust module into `src/cornucopia.rs`, then this is as simple as importing the items you need from it, like so:
```rust
use cornucopia::authors;
```

```admonish note
When a query's parameter or row has only one column, Cornucopia will not generate a struct for the parameter or row and use the inner type instead. Don't waste time looking for these items!
```

# Building the query object
Building a query starts with either the query function:
```rust
authors().bind(&client, Some("Greece"));
```
or the generated parameter struct:
```rust
AuthorsParams {
    country: Some("Greece")
}.bind(&client);
```
The query function is useful when you have a few obvious parameters, while the parameter struct is more explicit.

If you want even more clarity, you can mix both styles:
```rust
authors().params(&client, AuthorsParams {
    country: Some("Greece")
});
```

```admonish note
Queries that don't have a return value (insertions, for example) don't generate a query object. Instead, when calling `bind` or `params` they execute and return the number of rows affected.
```

# Row mapping (optional)
Query objects have a `map` method that allows them to transform the query's returned rows without requiring intermediate allocation:
```rust

enum Country {
    Greece,
    TheRest
}

impl<'a> From<&'a str> for Country {
    fn from(s: &'a str) -> Self {
        if s == "Greece" {
            Self::Greece
        } else {
                Self::TheRest
        }
    }
}

struct CustomAuthor {
    full_name: String,
    age: usize,
    country: String
}

all_authors()
    .bind(&client, Some("Greece"))
    .map(|author| {
        let full_name = format!(
            "{}, {}",
            author.last_name.to_uppercase(),
            author.first_name
        );
        CustomAuthor {
            full_name:,
            age: author.age,
            country: author.country.into()
        }
    });

```
The result of a map is another query object.

# Getting rows out of your queries
Once the query has been built, use one of the following methods to select the expected number of rows.
* `opt`: one or zero rows (error otherwise).
* `one`: exactly one row (error otherwise).
* `iter`: iterator of zero or more rows.
* `all`: like `iter`, but collects the rows in a  `Vec`.

Here are some examples:

```rust
author_by_id().bind(&client, &0).opt().await?;
author_by_id().bind(&client, &0).one().await?; // Error if this author id doesn't exist
select_42().bind(&client).one().await?;
all_authors().bind(&client).all().await?;
iter_authors().bind(&client).iter().await?.collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

```admonish note
If your queries are sync, you don't need to `.await` them.
```
