# API
Cornucopia's API offers functionalities similar to the CLI. The main benefit of the API over the CLI is to facilitate programmatic uses and to expose an error type.

For more information, you can read the library API [docs](https://docs.rs/crate/cornucopia/latest).

*Later on*, we plan to expose some of Cornucopia's abstractions to enable users to reuse its core parts and extend its behavior.
